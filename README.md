## 📘 About

The goal of this repository is to deeply understand modern machine learning concepts by:
- Studying the book **chapter by chapter**
- Re-implementing ideas from scratch where possible
- Experimenting beyond the book examples
- Connecting theory with practical ML engineering workflows

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a copy of the book.
